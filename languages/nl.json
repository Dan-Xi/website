         "intro":"A multisig consists of multiple (hardware) wallets and X-of-N transactions. You could have 5 wallets for example, and need 3 of them to sign your transaction (= send your bitcoin). You can pick any numbers you'd like. Higher numbers means more action is needed. Multisig is often considered the holy grail of self-custody security. It's also used within big custodial companies and exchanges to make sure not 1 single person can access the bitcoin, for example 3 wallets are needed (maybe the CEO, CFO and a dude named Ben always need to sign)",
         "warning":"For all actions you do with your multisig-secured bitcoin you need collaboration of multiple parties. This means more work is needed.",

         "intro":"You can put your secrets at a custodial party. Depending on the choices you made, more or less trust is needed. For a multisig or Shamir's Secret Sharing-scheme, less trust is needed than putting a copy of your seed at a 3rd party",
